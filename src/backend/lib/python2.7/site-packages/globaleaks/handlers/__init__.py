# In here you will find all the handlers that are tasked with handling the
# requests specified in the API.
#
# From these handlers we will be instantiating models objects that will take care
# of our business logic and the generation of the output to be sent to GLClient.
#
# In here we are also tasked with doing the validation of the user supplied
# input. This must be done before instantiating any models object.
# Validation of input may be done with the functions inside of
# globaleaks.rest.
#
# See base.BaseHandler for details on the handlers.
